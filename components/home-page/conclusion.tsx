              We are on a mission to create something truly special â€“ a women's
              fitness community that goes beyond workouts and embraces the power
              of sisterhood.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3 text-lg font-montreal">
              Too often, we encountered judgment, unrealistic standards, and a
              sense of inadequacy that left us feeling discouraged and
              disconnected in our fitness journeys.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3 text-lg font-montreal">
              Starting Pace Fitness has been a labour of love, born out of a
              desire to provide a space where women can thrive, support each
              other, and prioritise their mental health alongside their physical
              well-being. In this community, we uplift and inspire one another,
              celebrating our unique strengths and journeys so that each
              individual can grow at her own pace.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-3 text-lg font-montreal">
              Pace Fitness is not just about fitness; it's about fostering a
              sense of belonging, empowerment, and growth. Together, we are
              redefining what it means to be a strong and united community of
              women.
