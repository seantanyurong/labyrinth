                We are on a mission to create something truly special â€“ a
                women's fitness community that goes beyond workouts and embraces
                the power of sisterhood.

              <p className="mb-3 text-lg font-montreal">
                Too often, we encountered judgment, unrealistic standards, and a
                sense of inadequacy that left us feeling discouraged and
                disconnected in our fitness journeys.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-3 text-lg font-montreal">
                Starting Pace Fitness has been a labour of love, born out of a
                desire to provide a space where women can thrive, support each
                other, and prioritise their mental health alongside their
                physical well-being. In this community, we uplift and inspire
                one another, celebrating our unique strengths and journeys so
                that each individual can grow at her own pace.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-3 text-lg font-montreal">
                Pace Fitness is not just about fitness; it's about fostering a
                sense of belonging, empowerment, and growth. Together, we are
                redefining what it means to be a strong and united community of
                women.
